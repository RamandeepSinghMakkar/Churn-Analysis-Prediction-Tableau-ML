## Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, and analyzing churn patterns helps in developing retention strategies. This project consists of two key parts:

1️⃣ Churn Analysis : Utilizing Tableau dashboards to explore customer behavior, identify key factors contributing to churn, and visualize trends that impact customer retention. Tableau Public Link .

2️⃣ Churn Prediction : Implementing three Machine Learning Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN) to classify customers as potential churners, predict churn probability, and evaluate model accuracy using real customer data. Logistic Regression performed the best with an accuracy of 89.18%.

## Objectives

Identify Key Drivers Behind Customer Churn: Analyze customer data to pinpoint the primary factors contributing to churn.
Segment Customer Profiles: Classify customers according to their churn risk to understand which segments are most likely to leave the service.



## Tools and Technologies Used

Tableau: Data visualization, dashboards, and churn analysis.
Python (Jupyter Notebook): Data preprocessing and modeling.
Logistic Regression, Random Forest& KNN: Machine learning models for churn prediction.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and processing.
Git and GitHub: For Version Control.
